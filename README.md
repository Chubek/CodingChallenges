So far:

- A Pig Latin Parser. Simple program. Converts a string to "Latin de Cochon" i.e. Wolf becomes olfway.
- A Palindrome checker. It simply assesses if a string is a palindrome, i.e. its reverse is the same as the untouched word. Dad is a palindrome.
- Vowel Counter. Counts vowels in a string.
- A more sophisticated project, a notepad clone with spellcheck.
- A Visual Calculator.
- A word ladder creator.
- Powerplant simulator.
- Print iterator.
- Garage Door Simulator.
- A decimal to binary.


And many more!
